<p>Lauderhill,--FL report released Tuesday by the Broward Freedom Fighters demonstrated through long range data analysis that the gang affiliation and identifications practices utilized by the Broward Sheriffs Office (BSO) has been drastically under reported, misleading, and falsified.
<br><br>The issue was discovered last year when a report filed by a family member of the Lauderhill police department went uninvestigated, when it was followed up on by FDLE, there was no record which raised a lot of eyebrows. The followng investigation identified false informaitno in the criminal tracking and gnag related files as well.<br><br>FDLE Data Management Director <b>Alvin Fitzgerald</b> has said that there will be a thorough investigation into the records missing from the file of the 2nd largest county in the 3rd largest state. The public may never fully get an answer related to where the information chain was dissolved; that said all cases and investigations conducted during the period in question will be reviewed. While it may not come as a shock, the information that has been identified heavily impacts young blakc men of Broward who have been put in danger and incarcerated on what may have been faulty information. The directors indicated there will be a serious attempt to cross reference data
