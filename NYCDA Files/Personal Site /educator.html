    <p>I have run the company Doula for Dad and its related services since 2016. I have partnered via education series with the New York City Department of Health, The Healthy Action Committee, and American Heart Society. In addition I have worked with father focused organizations such as CRIB, SCO, and the Resiliency Advocacy Project. In addition Techmovr has a STEM focused computer program that is utilized by schools to engage young people in business skills development.
